You can find all my articles on my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=pgWeRbwAAAAJ&hl=en) profile or on [publicationslist.org](http://publicationslist.org/nhan-nguyen) - which is better organized but updated less often.

Here are a few highlights from my work.

**[Omics technologies to understand drug toxicity mechanisms](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.drudis.2022.103348)**

Drug side effects are an important study subject in pharmacology. Recent omics technologies provide a range of omics data and help to understand the biological mechanisms involved in drug effects. These modern technologies provide significant support to all biological disciplines, including drug toxicology. In this review, we provide an overview the use of omics applications to understand drug side effects at the molecular level. We discuss by available omics technologies, their possible uses, as well as their advantages and limitations.

**[Epirubicin alters DNA methylation profiles related to cardiotoxicity](https://doi.org/10.31083/j.fbl2706173)**

Epirubicin is used for cancer treatment but also increases the risk of heart failure. This study pinpointed the change in DNA methylation related to epirubicin-induced cardiotoxicity. This project followed up our previous work on establishing a bioinformatic workflow to analyze the alterations of DNA methylation in tissues after drug treatment ([link](https://doi.org/10.1145/3510427.3510437)).

**[Transcriptome analysis of long noncoding RNAs reveals their potential roles in anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ncrna.2022.01.002)**

This project unveiled the roles of long non-coding RNAs with their various biological functions and suggested long non-coding RNAs as a new perspective and a novel promising biomarker type to understand drug side effects.

**[Translational proteomics analysis of anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity from cardiac microtissues to human heart biopsies](https://doi.org/10.3389/fgene.2021.695625)**

Anthracycline is an important drug family used in cancer chemotherapy but it also increases the risk of heart failure. This project analyzed the proteomics data and detected several proteins as potential targets for further anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity investigation.
