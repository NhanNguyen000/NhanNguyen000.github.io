Publications
======
You can also find my articles on my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=pgWeRbwAAAAJ&hl=en) profile. Here are a few highlights from my work.

Research
======
My research lies at the intersection of two main areas: multi-omics analysis and the investigation of genetic and non-genetic factors (such as diseases, infections, drugs, etc.) that shape individual responses.

I am particularly interested in leveraging existing datasets to address new research questions and in transferring analytical techniques across different research domains.

**Drug side effects:**

Individual responses to drugs can vary widely due to genetic and molecular differences, leading to diverse side effect profiles. Studying these variations through multi-omics analysis helps uncover biological pathways underlying drug sensitivity and toxicity.

**Infections:**

Infectious agents interact dynamically with the host’s genetic and immune landscape, shaping disease outcomes and recovery patterns. Investigating these interactions provides insights into host–pathogen biology and mechanisms of immune regulation.

**Enviromental factors & life styles:**

Environmental exposures and lifestyle choices—such as diet, pollution, and physical activity—can profoundly influence molecular and physiological responses. Understanding these effects helps reveal how external factors modulate biological systems and contribute to health or disease risk.
