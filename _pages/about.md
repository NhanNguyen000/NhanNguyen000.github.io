Welcome! I am a senior postdoctoral researcher at Queen Mary University of London’s Precision Healthcare University Research Institute ([PHURI](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/phuri/)). My current research focuses on computational genomics and multi-omics analysis in population-based studies.
 
I earned my BSc in Biology at the Vietnam National University. I later did my MSc in Systems Biology and PhD in Bioinformatics at Maastricht University, the Netherlands, where I focussed on multi-omics analyses to understand drug side effects. After my PhD, I completed a postdoc at Helmholtz Center for Infection Research, Germany, studying multi-omics and immune phenotyping profiles to uncover patterns in individual immune responses.

I have been working with multi-omics datasets including DNA methylation, transcriptomics, proteomics (untargeted and targeted), and untargeted metabolites data. My research interests focussed on multi-omics analysis to reveal the influence of genetic and environmental risk factors on disease progress and individual responses.



Research
======
My research lies at the intersection of two main areas: multi-omics analysis and the investigation of genetic and non-genetic factors (such as diseases, infections, drugs, etc.) that shape individual responses.

I am particularly interested in leveraging existing datasets to address new research questions and in transferring analytical techniques across different research domains.

**Drug side effects:**
Individual responses to drugs can vary widely due to genetic and molecular differences, leading to diverse side effect profiles. Studying these variations through multi-omics analysis helps uncover biological pathways underlying drug sensitivity and toxicity.

**Infections:**
Infectious agents interact dynamically with the host’s genetic and immune landscape, shaping disease outcomes and recovery patterns. Investigating these interactions provides insights into host–pathogen biology and mechanisms of immune regulation.

**Enviromental factors & life styles:**
Environmental exposures and lifestyle choices—such as diet, pollution, and physical activity—can profoundly influence molecular and physiological responses. Understanding these effects helps reveal how external factors modulate biological systems and contribute to health or disease risk.
