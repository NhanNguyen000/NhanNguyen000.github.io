Welcome! I am a senior postdoctoral researcher at Queen Mary University of Londonâ€™s Precision Healthcare University Research Institute ([PHURI](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/phuri/)). My current research focuses on computational genomics and multi-omics analysis in population-based studies.
 
I earned my BSc in Biology at the Vietnam National University. I later did my MSc in Systems Biology and PhD in Bioinformatics at Maastricht University, the Netherlands, where I focussed on multi-omics analyses to understand drug side effects. After my PhD, I completed a postdoc at Helmholtz Center for Infection Research, Germany, studying multi-omics and immune phenotyping profiles to uncover patterns in individual immune responses.

I have been working with multi-omics datasets including DNA methylation, transcriptomics, proteomics (untargeted and targeted), and untargeted metabolites data. My research interests focussed on multi-omics analysis to reveal the influence of genetic and environmental risk factors on disease progress and individual responses.
