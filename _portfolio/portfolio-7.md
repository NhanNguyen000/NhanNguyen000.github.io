The "Inspire high school kids!" program aims to introduce what university and researchers do and offer career exploration opportunities to high school student. In this program, researchers can give one-hour workshop about their research topics. My workshop focuses on bioinformatics, in which I give an overview about bioinformatics and some examples on how bioinformatics can apply in pharmacology and medicine areas.

The workshop has been given to:
