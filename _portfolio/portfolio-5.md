The Maastricht University Challenge is an competition for students and recent graduates of Maastricht University and Zuyd Hogeschool to develop innovative ideas related to societal and entrepreneurial issues.

In few months, we had developed our idea about a PharmaTranslate app. Our app PharmaTranslate allows travelers, refugees and expats to insert the generic name of the medicine they are familiar with in their native country and obtain the corresponding one used in the country where they currently are.
