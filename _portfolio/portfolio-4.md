We are facing the Corona pandemic in the Netherlands. There are daily updates about new COVID-19 cases, number of deaths, but also precautions measurements in multiple channels. Most of them are in Dutch, which are inconvenient for a large population of non-Dutch speaking citizens.

Therefore, we have built this web application (https://coronanewshub.github.io/) for expats, so people can keep up-to-date with the COVID-19 news. This web application collects the news from different sources (RIVM, Dutch government), but also provides you with figures regarding Corona cases.
